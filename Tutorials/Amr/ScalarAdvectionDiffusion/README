Advection_AmrLevel: This tutorial contains an AMR scalar advection/diffusion code that advects 
and diffuses a single scalar field.  The diffusion is done explcitly so this will only be stable
if the diffusion constant is small (dt_diff = h^2/nu, dt_hyp = h/v_max---need dt_diff >= dt_hyp.
This means that the diffusion constant less than the finest grid spacing scaled by the fastest 
wave speed (nu < h*vmax )).
The velocity field that is specified on faces and 
the diffusion coefficient is constant.

It is an AMReX based code designed to run in parallel using MPI/OMP.

This example uses source code from the amrex/Src/Base, Boundary, AmrCore , and
Amr directories.

The directories Exec/SingleVortex and Exec/UniformVelocity each include 
a makefile and a sample inputs file.  
Plotfiles are generated that can be viewed with amrvis2d / amrvis3d
(CCSE's native vis / spreadsheet tool, downloadable separately from ccse.lbl.gov)
or with VisIt.
